# Testing Strategy for MyNews v2

This document outlines the testing strategy and approach for the MyNews v2 application.

## Testing Framework

We use Jest as our primary test runner along with React Testing Library for testing React components. The testing setup includes:

- **Jest**: For running tests and providing assertions
- **React Testing Library**: For rendering and interacting with React components
- **user-event**: For simulating realistic user interactions
- **MSW (Mock Service Worker)**: For mocking API requests

## Types of Tests

### Unit Tests

Unit tests focus on testing individual functions, components, or modules in isolation. Examples include:

- Component rendering tests
- Service function tests with mocked dependencies
- Utility function tests

### Integration Tests

Integration tests verify that different parts of the application work together correctly. Examples include:

- Testing context providers with their consumers
- Testing components that interact with each other
- Testing data flow between components

### End-to-End Tests

End-to-end tests simulate real user scenarios and test the application as a whole. These can be added with tools like Cypress or Playwright in the future.

## Test Files Structure

Tests are organized following the same structure as the application code:

```
src/
  app/
    components/
      __tests__/        # Tests for components
        Divider.test.tsx
        SearchSection.test.tsx
        ...
    services/
      __tests__/        # Tests for services
        newsService.test.ts
        ...
    context/
      __tests__/        # Tests for contexts
        AuthContext.test.tsx
        ...
    __tests__/          # Tests for pages and app-level features
      Home.test.tsx
      ...
```

## Running Tests

To run the tests, use the following npm scripts:

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run tests in watch mode (for development)
npm run test:watch

# Run tests with coverage report
npm run test:coverage
```

## Mocking Strategy

- **API Calls**: We mock API services to avoid making actual network requests during tests
- **Firebase**: Firebase services are mocked to simulate authentication and database operations
- **Next.js Router**: Next.js navigation functions are mocked to test navigation-related functionality
- **Context Providers**: We use real context providers with mocked services to test components

## What to Test

### Components
- Rendering: Test that components render correctly with different props
- User Interactions: Test component behavior when users interact with it (click, input, etc.)
- State Changes: Test that component state changes correctly based on interactions

### Services
- API Calls: Test API call functions with mocked responses
- Data Transformation: Test data normalization and transformation logic
- Error Handling: Test error cases and fallback behavior

### Context
- State Management: Test that context state is updated correctly
- Provider Integration: Test that components can access context values

## Code Coverage Goals

We aim for:
- 80% or higher code coverage for services and utilities
- 70% or higher code coverage for React components
- Focus on testing business logic and user interactions rather than just rendering

## Adding New Tests

When adding new features or fixing bugs:
1. Write tests before or alongside implementation
2. Cover both happy path and edge cases/error scenarios
3. Ensure tests are meaningful and test behavior, not implementation details
4. Run the test suite to ensure your changes don't break existing functionality
